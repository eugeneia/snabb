# Basic Apps (apps.basic.basic_apps)

The module *apps.basic.basic_apps* provides apps with general
functionality for use in you app networks.

## Source

The `Source` app is a synthetic packet generator. On each breath it fills
each attached output link with new packets. The packet data is
uninitialized garbage and each packet is 60 bytes long.

## Join

The `Join` app joins together packets from N input links onto one
output link. On each breath it outputs as many packets as possible
from the inputs onto the output.

## Split

The `Split` app splits packets from multiple inputs across multiple
outputs. On each breath it transfers as many packets as possible from
the input links to the output links.

## Sink

The `Sink` app receives all packets from any number of input links and
discards them. This can be handy in combination with a `Source`.

## Tee

The `Tee` app receives all packets from any number of input links and
transfers each received packet to all output links. It can be used to
merge and/or duplicate packet streams

## Repeater

The `Repeater` app collects all packets received from the `input` link
and repeatedly transfers the accumulated packets to the `output`
link. The packets are transmitted in the order they were received.
